          <p>
            The micro tasker is a personal task micro manager to help track your
            daily tasks. It combines the functionality of Trello and Clockify
            but at a very basic level. It is not as complex as either of these
            sites. It is meant for personal use.

          <h3><em>Why am I building it?</em></h3>
          <p>
            I started working on this project at a Javascript react club
            organised by The Shortcut. The mentor at the club suggested that we
            build an app for task management as it is very easily scalable. This
            made a lot of sense to me, as at that time I was working on another
            project in which I was wasting a great deal of time deciding the
            requirements! When I began my career as a trainee in software I
            struggled a bit with estimation. To help deal with this, I decided
            to build this project with time tracking which will serve as a guide
            to estimating my work in the future.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3><em>What does it do?</em></h3>
          <img
            class="img-project-dets pad-right"
            src="images/login_micro_tasker.JPG"
            alt="MicroTasker login page"
            align="left"
          />
          <p>
            The functionality built so far includes creating lists and cards and
            time tracking on the cards. Time tracked on the card can be viewed
            as a table. The cards can also be linked to a project and a report
            generated on the time spent on it. User authentication is also
            implemented. The timer can only run on one task at a time, if
            another is started the currently running task is stopped after
            confirmation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3><em>What will it do in the future?</em></h3>
          <p>
            I am currently working on extending the project to display a graph
            of the project report. It will also include viewing tasks in the
            calendar (planned vs actual). In the calendar the user, would be
            able to select tasks from the existing cards, to help plan their
            work for a particular day. I will also be adding drag and drop
            functionality and improving the responsiveness and accessibility. I
            would like to add Redux to as state management has become a little
            complex and some data is re-fetched unneccesarily from the server. I
            would like to improve the UX, adding spinners etc. Adding notes with
            labels, and checklists on a task will also be possible in the
            future.

            This is the first big project I am building as a web developer. In
            my previous IT experience, it has always been with specific
            requirements, so that was a struggle. I wanted to build this one
            without frameworks like Material-UI and ReactStrap as I thought that
            this would give me an opportunity to learn React better. I found
            this to be true while building a reuseable Modal component. It was
            challenging for example to keep the focus inside the modal for
            keyboard users, and I had to take care of little things like
            freezing a modal when another is opened inside it or a field is
            being edited. I learnt how to manipulate the DOM in react using the
            useRef hook. Another challenge was building a reuseable Editable
            component. Its functionality is when a field is clicked on (or Enter
            for keyboard users), a textarea is displayed and can be edited. I
            learnt that it is possible to add event handling functions to react
            children while making this reuseable component.

          <p>
            It is as the name suggests an app to find and identify species in
            Finland. Birds, butterflies, spiders etc. Adding a description
            should return a result of possibilities.

            It is like a pet project for me. I would love to have a site like
            this which will help me identify any species I see, even if I don't
            manage to capture an image. There are similar sites with listings
            but I haven't found a comprehensive one which easily helps identify
            any species. I can build parts of it like bird and butterfly
            identification by description but I have currently put this project
            on hold until I can find an API which returns pictures of all the
            birds or species. Finding and building, the data is the biggest road
            block for this. So I decided to park this for a while and used this
            project as an opportunity to practice Material-UI framework. I used
            it to build an AppBar.

          <h3>Why did I build this?</h3>
          <p>
            This was done as a part of the freecodecamp exercise. The exercise
            required bulding a form and I built one on Environmental awareness
            as this interests me. There is no backend, on submitting the form
            only a page redirect happens.
